"ms" version May 29, 2007.

See "ms-Readme.txt" in this directory for more information about "ms".

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I turn "ms" in a library format by adding and modifing some functions, "R_*.c",
for directorly using "msdir" in R, and the standardlone version will not
be guaranteed here. Try the original "ms" for standardlone.

I modify the source codes in order to avoid enormous warnings from "gcc" and
stuck by pointer missed reallociation including output results to file
instead of stdout, and memory leaks and release.
I also modify the random seed and random number generator and replace them by
the functions of R. The codes pass the examination of valgrind and R checking.

I also do my best to keep the original functionality of "ms", and only
modify the part of input and output. Most, I save data in temporary files
or directory generated by R, and redirect "ms" to those temporary files.
When "ms" is finish, I scan the output from those files, trun into
an R objects, and unlink those files.
