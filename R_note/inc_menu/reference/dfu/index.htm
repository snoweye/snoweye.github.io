<h1>Uffe's DLL examples </h1>
<p>Here you can find little examples - in the 'Hello, world!' style - of making
DLL's in a few development environments:</p>

<ul>
<li>
 <a href="dlls_in_delphi.htm" tppabs="http://www.dfu.min.dk/uht/Software/DLL/dlls_in_delphi.htm">Delphi</a> by itself and 
 <a href="delphi_dlls_for_R.htm" tppabs="http://www.dfu.min.dk/uht/Software/DLL/delphi_dlls_for_R.htm">Delphi for R</a>
</li>
<li>
 <a href="borland.htm" tppabs="http://www.dfu.min.dk/uht/Software/DLL/borland.htm">Borland C++ Builder</a>
</li>
<li>
 <a href="msvc.htm" tppabs="http://www.dfu.min.dk/uht/Software/DLL/msvc.htm">Microsoft Visual C++</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I test the DLL's by calling the from <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.r-project.org/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.r-project.org/'" tppabs="http://www.r-project.org/" target="_top">R</a>.
</p>

<p>
In addition, <a href="oo.htm" tppabs="http://www.dfu.min.dk/uht/Software/DLL/oo.htm">here</a> is an example of 
how to define classes in C++
and make objects accesible to R
</p>

<h4>Why do I care about DLL's? </h4>

<p>
Because it has happened to me on a number of occasions that 
colleagues ask me about some mathematical problem and I find
that the best answer is to provide a little algorithm which 
does the analysis. The algorithm is typically written in another
language and with another development tool than the rest of
their application, so simply passing on a DLL is the cleanest interface.
</p>

<p>This also implies that I focus on DLL's which contain little
number-crunching functions.</p>
