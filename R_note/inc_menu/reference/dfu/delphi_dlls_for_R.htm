<title>Delphi DLL's for R</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Writing DLL's for R in Delphi</h1>

<p>Delphi is not the most natural choice to make DLL's for R in, because R is
based on C. When your DLL's will contain a lot of pointer gymnastics it is a
little clumbsy because Object Pascal does not allow much pointer arithmitic.</p>
<p>Anyway, it can be done. Here is the source code for the Max function. Notice </p>

<ol>
  <li>The function is &quot;void&quot; - the result is returned in the third
    argument</li>
  <li>Arguments are pointers.</li>
</ol>

<pre class="csource">
library MyMaxLib; // File MyMax.pas

// This is a DLL with an R-style interface ...
// it exports the MyMax function.

uses
  SysUtils,
  Classes;

type
  pD = ^Double;

procedure MyMax(X,Y,Z: pD); stdcall;
begin
   if (X^ &lt; Y^) then Z^:=Y^ else Z^:= X^;
end;

exports 
  MyMax index 1;
begin
end.
</pre>

<p>To compile this into a DLL, execute &quot;dcc32 MyMax.pas&quot; from the
command prompt (assuming that the source code is residing in MyMax.pas)</p>
<p>To call this from R, you need a wrapper. Here's one, called test.r</p>

<pre class="rsource">
# Set-up test of the MyMax DLL
setwd(&quot;c:/uht/Delphi/R-DLL&quot;)  # ... replace with the proper path

dyn.load(&quot;MyMax.dll&quot;)
MyMax &lt;- function(a,b) 
{
  c &lt;- as.integer(0); 
  ans &lt;- .C(&quot;MyMax&quot;,
	as.double(a),
	as.double(b),
	as.double(c)
    )
  ans[[3]]
}

MyMax(12,23.1)
</pre>

<p>Notice the explicit type-casting (&quot;as.double ...&quot;). This is to make
sure that the DLL gets what it expects, a pointer to a double.</p>

<p>Notice: This DLL is not &quot;vectorised&quot; as most R functions are and
should be. What I mean is, if you call this with</p>

<pre class="rsource">
> MyMax(c(12,34.1),17.1)
</pre>

<p>then you get just 17.1 - the largest of the first elements. But hey.</p>
