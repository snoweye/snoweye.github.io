
Test 1
MSG: Initial value: a1 = 1, a2 = 1
	aa MSG: Value of aa1: 1
	aa MSG: After a change, value: aa1 = 2
MSG: after a change: a1 = 1, a2 = 2
------------

Test 2	(Pass "the address of b1" to function bb)
MSG: Initial value: b1 = 1, b2 = 1
MSG: Address of b1 (&b1): bfc585d4
	bb MSG: Value of bb1: bfc585d4
		(This should be the address of b1)
	bb MSG: Address of bb1 (&bb1): bfc585b0
	bb MSG: After a change, value: *bb1 = 2 (changed)
MSG: after a change: b1 = 2, b2 = 2
	(These should be equal to *bb1)
------------

Test 3
MSG: Initial value: c1 = &b1 = bfc585d4
	(This should be equal to the address of b1)
     c1 point to b1 which has same value *c1 = b1 = 2
	(This should be equal to the value of b2)
     c1 is at address = bfc585d0

(As Test2, but pass "c1" to function bb)
	bb MSG: Value of bb1: bfc585d4
		(This should be the address of b1)
	bb MSG: Address of bb1 (&bb1): bfc585b0
	bb MSG: After a change, value: *bb1 = 4 (changed)
(This should be twice of b1 in the first Test 2)
MSG: after a change: b1 = 4, b2 = 2
	(These should be equal to *bb1)

(As Test1, but pass "*c1" to function aa)
	aa MSG: Value of aa1: 4
	aa MSG: After a change, value: aa1 = 8
MSG: After a change: *c1 = 4 (no changed), a3 = 8
------------

Test 4
MSG: array d1 = {6 4 2}
