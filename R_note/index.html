#### R_note -- The Exploration of Statistical Software R

The <a href="./lists_notes.html">Lists of All Notes</a> has the all materials.
Most of notes were done around 2003 to 2005, then some were around 2008 to 2011,
then later a few were around 2012 to 2014.

All references are collected at
"<a href="./inc_menu/reference.html">Reference</a>".
Several useful links are already untraceable.
In case of the original page loses, I have made a mirror
for each on-line documents or packages, and the
source links and the mirrors will be provided simultaneously.
Please tell me any place where should be cited if I forget
and it is original in this note.
Please tell me any mirror where violates your
copyright in this note,
it must be removed immediately.

The goal of this note of R is
"<font color="green"><b>keep it simple, keep it short,
and keep it clear</b></font>".
This note demonstrates as "step by step" in different levels from
basic commands to complex programming.
Some are not easy, but it should be useful for advanced users
to handle with other applications.
Each topic is explained by simple examples, which are
collected from on-line documents, textbooks,
or simplified from my programs.
In each line of examples, all are subjectively meaningful
either for computer scientists or statisticians.

#### About R's version

R version 1.6 for MS windows was used to write this note. Most examples can also run for version 1.5 to 2.4.
Without any claim, all codes used in examples were presumed to be coded in
R version 1.6 and Linux System.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan" target="_blank">
Taiwan</a>,
they offered me a chance as part of my military service,
and provided an environment
to try and write a lot of different applications.
Although some ideas were not mature enough during this period,
I tried to write down every key points
according to my programming experience.
Any topic, which I interest in and is not completed
will be listed in the section of
"<a href="./inc_menu/notend.html">Not end</a>".
